        <p>These guidelines apply to all of the meditations offered on this website. They will also be useful for
            anyone who is finding their own way to meditate and wants an easy, natural meditation style.
        </p>
<hr>
        <h4>How Long to Meditate</h4>
         <p>Usually 15-30 minutes is a good meditation time, although if you are new to meditation, you may want to start
             with 5 or 10 and build up. If you meditate regularly, it can be helpful to meditate about the same number of minutes
             each time. (An exception is our Meditation-in-Action which is done for longer periods of time while engaged in activity.)</p>

         <h4>When to meditate</h4>
         <p>When you meditate will partly depend on what kind of meditation you are doing and the purpose of the meditation.
             Although you can meditate at any time, the ideal times are usually in the morning as a start to your day, or in the
             late afternoon in order to unwind from the activity of the day and be refreshed for the evening.</p>
         <p>If you do a meditation which energizes you, it's better not to do it before bedtime. Some meditations, however,
             are specifically designed for falling asleep and many people find listening to many of our guided meditations helps
             them relax into sleep.</p>
         <p>Meditations which are deeply relaxing are best done on an empty stomach or at least a couple of hours after a meal.</p>

         <h4>How often to meditate</h4>
         <p>The ideal frequency of meditation may vary from person to person depending on many different factors.  Generally
             speaking, once or twice a day is ideal.  A regular routine of meditation is invaluable.  The benefit derived from
             meditation starts to carry over into our activity more when we meditate regularly.  Many find twice a day to be ideal,
             but certainly even once a day can make a big difference.</p>

         <h4>Thoughts in meditation</h4>
         <p>Thoughts arise spontaneously in the mind. They are a natural part of meditation. The goal of meditation is to become
             more at ease, relaxed and at peace with whatever is happening. Therefore, it is important to not resist anything that
             comes in meditation, including thoughts.</p>
         <p>Don't try to push out thoughts or resist them. Simply notice that thoughts are present and let them go the way they
             come -- effortlessly. When you find that the awareness has been caught up in a train of thought, easily come back to
             the focus of your meditation. (This will vary depending on the type of meditation you are doing. In a breath meditation,
             for example, come easily back to the experience of the breath.)</p>
         <p>It's important to understand that you have not made a mistake when thoughts come or the mind has become absorbed in
          thought. It's a natural part of meditation. The mind may get caught up in a "story" about what is happening in our life,
             or even what is happening in meditation -- what has happened or will happen. Likewise, we can let go of that. Don't
             purposely follow the train of thought. Let it go. Let go of the meaning of thoughts. Let thoughts be a meaningless activity
             in the mind!</p>
          <h4>Ending Meditation</h4>
          <p>It's important to take time to come out of meditation slowly. When we are deeply rested in meditation, it can be
              jarring to suddenly get up and start our activity. Remain with your eyes closed for a minute or two. Stretch, move
              around a bit, and gradually become more active. When you are ready to open your eyes, you can open them downcast at
              first. Take your time!</p>
